## Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm a software engineer passionate about building accessible and scalable software!

**Pronouns: he/him/his**

I've been obsessed with computers and technology throughout my entire life. I used to create video game web forums back before 2010 using VBulletin which is how I got my start in the web. From there I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have had a love for technology, programming, and web development ever since.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Boise State University and found out that my love of technology was also **a love of solving complex, challenging, and interesting problems**.

Since graduating, I've been working as a software engineer helping companies and organizations solve challenges to help their business grow and scale. I also have enjoyed leading, teaching, supporting, and mentoring other engineers and serving as a leader across the organizations I have been a part of.

Besides programming, I enjoy working with even more technology! This past year I setup a home server to serve as a file storage backup and media hoster on my network. I also enjoy cycling, playing video games, and occasionally collecting video games and PokÃ©mon cards.
